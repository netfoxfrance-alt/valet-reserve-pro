      "q1": "Can CleaningPage replace my website?",
      "a1": "Yes.\n\nCleaningPage can perfectly replace a website.\n\nYou get an online storefront that you customize however you like.\n\nThe difference is that on top of a classic website, you get a booking system, request management, client tracking and complete business organization.\n\nBut if you want to keep your current website, you can use CleaningPage as a complement.\n\nJust add your website link in your CleaningPage and use it solely as a booking page.",
      "q2": "Is CleaningPage suitable for all types of cleaning businesses?",
      "a2": "Yes.\n\nIf you work with fixed packages (e.g. auto detailing), your clients book the service that suits them directly.\n\nIf you work with quotes (windows, house, offices…), you simply assign a custom service to your client.\n\nThen, they just enter their email in the \"custom service / identify yourself\" section to find their service and book whenever they want.\n\nIt's simple: you create the service, the client books it.\n\nYou can also add one-time services at any time.",
      "q3": "Is it complicated to set up?",
      "a3": "No.\n\nIt's simple and intuitive.\n\nYou fill in your information, customize your page as you wish and you can start immediately.\n\nNo technical skills required.\n\nAnd you can modify your page or services whenever you want.",
      "q4": "Can I still receive requests by phone?",
      "a4": "Yes, and it's actually an advantage.\n\nIf a client calls you, you can create a booking in 1 click from your dashboard.\n\nIt's automatically added to your schedule and statistics.\n\nThis way, even your phone requests are centralized and organized.",
      "q5": "Do my clients need to create an account?",
      "a5": "No.\n\nThey simply fill in their information to book or make a request.\n\nThe process is quick and simple.",
      "q6": "How am I notified when a client makes a request?",
      "a6": "You receive a notification and find all the information in your dashboard.\n\nNo request goes unnoticed.",
      "q7": "Can I modify a service after receiving it?",
      "a7": "Yes.\n\nYou can adjust the details, modify the price or adapt the service before confirmation.",
      "q8": "Can I try it for free?",
      "a8": "Yes.\n\nThe first 30 days are free, with no commitment.\n\nTry it, and see for yourself if CleaningPage fits your business."
